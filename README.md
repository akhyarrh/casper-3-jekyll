# Casper port to Jekyll

This is just another port of [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper)
from [Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/ghost) to Jekyll.

Version I use is 3.1.1. [See Casper release](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases).

See also: [kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper), [jasper](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper), [jasper2](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2/).

## Notes

- This is ~~broken~~ experimental.
- Most value are hardcoded.
- This is a straight port.
- Insert new problem here.

My background to port this is because I want Casper on Jekyll,
but with dark theme. Without tag and author page. There you go.
